# Teleoperated VR + UR10e Thesis 

This thesis project integrates Unity, Leap Motion, and a UR10e digital twin with VR/AR cameras and haptic feedback.

- Teleoperation of UR10e robot using VR controllers
- Leap Motion hand tracking and Unity integration
- Digital twin simulation of the robot
- Haptic feedback system (placeholder) for collision/contact simulation
- Variable impedance control implemented for robot interaction
- Camera calibration and AR passthrough integration
