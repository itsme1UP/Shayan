# VR and AR Camera Calibration Project

This project performs full calibration of VR and AR cameras (e.g., Hololens, Zed Mini, and standard digital cameras).

- Checkerboard-based calibration using OpenCV
- Computes intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters
- Handles multiple cameras for mixed VR/AR setups
- Scripts include calibration, reprojection visualization, and saving calibration results
